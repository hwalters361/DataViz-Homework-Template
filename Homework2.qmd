# Scoring Insights: Analyzing the Los Angeles Lakers' Performance Trends and Season Dynamics 

## Motivation

Basketball is more than just a game—it's a sport that influences both fans and professionals alike, from casual enthusiasts to coaches and analysts. In this report, we will analyze game statistics obtained from Kaggle, focusing specifically on one of the most iconic teams in NBA history; the Los Angeles Lakers. By looking at historical data, we can track the Lakers' progress and identify trends in their performance over time. This can help them understand how the team has evolved and assess their potential for future success. We can also observe key game statistics to see the relationship between these statistics, to see which variables are dependent or independent of each other and make better game predictions. This analysis has implications for Lakers fans and sports betters who could use this data to predict the outcome of future games and seasons or to better understand the relationship between different basketball metrics.

## Setup

First we include our necessary imports:

```{python}
from plotnine import *
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import norm
```

Then we read in a CSV file of our NBA game data. This is from the Kaggle NBA basketball dataset and we are using the data file "game.csv". [Here's the link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball).


```{python}
game = pd.read_csv('game.csv')
game.head()
```

Next we will drop all rows of this dataset that are missing data
```{python}
game_cleaned = game.dropna()
```

We are only interested in the Laker's game data. We will exclude all rows except for the Lakers:

```{python}
lakers = game_cleaned[(game_cleaned['team_name_home'] == 'Los Angeles Lakers') | (game_cleaned['team_name_away'] == 'Los Angeles Lakers')]
lakers.head()
```

The variables that we will use in this report are `team_name_home` (str), `team_name_away` (str), `game_date` (date), `pts_home` (int), `pts_away` (int), and `season_type` (str).

## First Visualization - Yearly Points Analysis: Lakers' Performance Across Season Types

Now we will visualize the performance of the Lakers in all recorded games. We visualize below the points the Lakers score per-game year by year. We can also compare the performance by season type: whether the Lakers played in the Playoffs, Pre Season, or the Regular Season.

```{python}
lakers_year_points = lakers[['game_date', 'pts_home', 'pts_away', 'team_name_home', 'team_name_away', 'season_type']].copy()

lakers_year_points['year'] = pd.to_datetime(lakers_year_points['game_date']).dt.year

lakers_year_points['lakers_pts'] = np.where(lakers_year_points['team_name_home'] == 'Los Angeles Lakers', lakers_year_points['pts_home'], lakers_year_points['pts_away'])

p = (ggplot(lakers_year_points, aes(x='year', y='lakers_pts', color='season_type'))
     + geom_point(alpha=0.6)
     + labs(x='Year', y='Lakers Points', color='Season Type',
            title='Relationship Between Year and Lakers Points by Season Type'))

p.show()
```

The graph illustrates that the Lakers' performance has remained relatively consistent over the years, regardless of the season type. Notably, there is a slight decline in their average points scored per game from 1985 to 2000. Additionally, the graph provides insights into the number of games the Lakers have played, highlighting the introduction of Pre-Season games around the mid-2000s. This context allows for a clearer comparison of the ratios of Pre-Season and Playoff games to Regular Season games. The data shows that Regular Season games significantly outnumber both Pre-Season and Playoff games, with the Lakers participating in 2,944 Regular Season games, 377 Playoff games, and 109 Pre-Season games.

This visualization employs three variables from our dataset: the year a game was played (interval), the number of points scored (interval), and the type of season (nominal).

The next plot below visualizes the average points scored by the Lakers each year, categorized by season type. 

```{python}
lakers_yearly_avg_pts = lakers_year_points.groupby(['year', 'season_type'])['lakers_pts'].mean().reset_index()

p = (ggplot(lakers_yearly_avg_pts, aes(x='year', y='lakers_pts', color='season_type'))
     + geom_line()
     + labs(x='Year', y='Average Lakers Points', color='Season Type',
            title='Average Lakers Points Per Year by Season Type')
     
     )


p.show()
```

This plot effectively highlights the trends in average points scored per game around the 2000s, particularly when compared to games played before 1990. It also clearly illustrates the variability in average points scored. From the visualization, we can conclude that the Lakers’ performance is consistent across different season types, with annual average points typically ranging between 90 and 120, though with notable fluctuations.

The visualization was created by aggregating the data, grouping it by season type, and calculating the yearly mean. It incorporates two interval variables and one nominal variable.

Here is another visualization that illustrates the points scored by the Lakers based on the season type alone:

```{python}
p = (ggplot(lakers_year_points, aes(x='season_type', y='lakers_pts', fill='season_type'))
     + geom_boxplot()
     + labs(x='Season Type', y='Lakers Points', fill='Season Type',
            title='Lakers Points by Season Type')
     + scale_fill_manual(values=['#000000', '#552583', '#FDB927']) 
     )

p.show()
```

This plot allows for a clearer comparison of the Lakers' performance across different season types. It reveals that the average points scored during the Regular Season are higher than those in both the Pre-Season and Playoffs. While the differences in performance among these seasons are relatively small and not statistically significant, it appears that the Lakers tend to perform the weakest during the Pre-Season compared to their Regular Season performance. This insight may be valuable for predicting the Lakers' outcomes in future Pre-Season games.



## Second Visualization - Lakers Points Versus Opponent Points

We were particularly curious about the relationship between the points scored by the Lakers and those scored by their opponents. If these two variables are not related, it would suggest that the points scored by each team are uniformly distributed and equally likely. Conversely, if there is a relationship, we might infer the Lakers' scoring based on their opponents' performance. This insight could have implications for sports betting, as certain scoring pairs may be more likely than others.

To explore this, we first plotted the distribution of points scored by both teams:

```{python}
lakers_points = lakers[['pts_home', 'pts_away']].copy()

lakers_points['lakers_pts'] = np.where(lakers['team_name_home'] == 'Los Angeles Lakers', lakers_points['pts_home'], lakers_points['pts_away'])
lakers_points['opponent_pts'] = np.where(lakers['team_name_home'] == 'Los Angeles Lakers', lakers_points['pts_away'], lakers_points['pts_home'])

p = (ggplot(lakers_points, aes(x='lakers_pts', y='opponent_pts'))
     + geom_bin2d()
     + labs(x='Lakers Points', y='Opponent Points',
            title='Density Plot: Lakers Points vs. Opponent Points'))

p.show()
```

Next we calculated the correlation between the two variables:

```{python}
correlation = lakers_points['lakers_pts'].corr(lakers_points['opponent_pts'])
print(f"Correlation between Lakers points and opponent points: {correlation}")
```

The analysis reveals a slight positive correlation between the points scored by the Lakers and those scored by their opponents. This indicates that when opponents score more, the Lakers are likely to score higher as well.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis of the Los Angeles Lakers' performance through various visualizations has provided valuable insights into their historical game statistics. By examining the points scored over the years and across different season types, we observed consistent trends, including a notable decrease in points from 1985 to 2000 and variability in average scores, particularly around the 2000s. The comparative box plots revealed that while the Lakers perform best in the Regular Season, the differences between season types were marginal. Furthermore, our exploration of the relationship between the points scored by the Lakers and their opponents indicated a slight positive correlation, suggesting that understanding opponent performance may aid in predicting future outcomes. This analysis not only enriches our understanding of the Lakers' dynamics but also serves as a resource for fans, analysts, and sports bettors seeking to navigate the complexities of basketball performance metrics.
